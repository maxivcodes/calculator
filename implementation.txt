Implementation Approach:

1. HTML Form :I  Designed a user-friendly form for inputting numerical values and selecting operations involved in calculation.

PHP Script: I created functions for each calculation type and handled form submission to process and calculate results of the users input.

Data Flow: The form sends data to the PHP script, which performs calculations and redirects back to the form with the result.
